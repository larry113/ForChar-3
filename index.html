    <h1>March 14</h1>

    <div id="scene1" class="scene active">
        <p>You play as a very short nerdy guy who goes by the name of Lawrence. The scene is Thursday night at the Robinhood happy hour. Across the room, you see a girl dancing. Captivated by her beauty, do you:</p>
        <button class="choice" onclick="goToScene('scene2')">Approach her and ask her to dance</button>
        <button class="choice" onclick="goToScene('scene3')">Watch quietly, mesmerized</button>
    </div>

    <div id="scene2" class="scene">
        <p>She introduces herself as Charlotte. She smiles and says she doesn't normally dance with men under 6 ft. She makes an exception and agrees to teach you some Zouk steps. You stumble but she's patient. Afterward, she asks if you'd like to grab oysters at Whole Foods. Do you:</p>
        <button class="choice" onclick="goToScene('scene4')">Go with her</button>
        <button class="choice" onclick="goToScene('scene5')">Suggest a different place</button>
    </div>

    <div id="scene3" class="scene">
        <p>You watch her dance, enchanted. Later, she notices you and walks over to introduce herself as Charlotte. She teasingly asks if you were too shy to ask her to dance. You laugh and she offers to teach you. Do you:</p>
        <button class="choice" onclick="goToScene('scene2')">Accept her offer</button>
        <button class="choice" onclick="goToScene('scene6')">Tell her you're better at watching</button>
    </div>

    <div id="scene4" class="scene">
        <p>Over oysters at Whole Foods, you bond over travel stories. She mentions her hometown of Vancouver and her love of K-dramas. Do you:</p>
        <button class="choice" onclick="goToScene('scene7')">Tell her you'd love to visit Vancouver with her</button>
        <button class="choice" onclick="goToScene('scene8')">Share your favorite K-drama</button>
    </div>

    <div id="scene5" class="scene">
        <p>You suggest a halal cart instead. She laughs and says she'll take you for oysters next time. Over dinner, you bond over K-dramas and she invites you to watch one together. Do you:</p>
        <button class="choice" onclick="goToScene('scene8')">Say yes to the K-drama date</button>
        <button class="choice" onclick="goToScene('scene9')">Propose a dance social instead</button>
    </div>

    <div id="scene6" class="scene">
        <p>"Your loss!" she says with a grin. But later, she finds you again and insists you try. Turns out... you love it. The two of you laugh as you stumble through the steps.</p>
        <button class="choice" onclick="goToScene('scene4')">Take her to grab oysters at Whole Foods</button>
    </div>

    <div id="scene7" class="scene">
        <p>"Deal!" she says with a smile. Later that year, you find yourselves in Vancouver, walking by the waterfront and dancing under the city lights.</p>
        <p><b>Happy Anniversary!</b></p>
    </div>

    <div id="scene8" class="scene">
        <p>You pick a K-drama to binge together. One night turns into several, and soon itâ€™s a tradition. Yet somehow, you never finish the series. The two of you find yourselves cuddled on the couch every weekend.</p>
        <p><b>Happy Anniversary!</b></p>
    </div>

    <div id="scene9" class="scene">
        <p>"Only if you promise not to step on my toes," she laughs. You dance until the sun comes up. The two of you walk off into the sunrise, arguing about how parking lots work.</p>
        <p><b>Happy Anniversary!</b></p>
    </div>
